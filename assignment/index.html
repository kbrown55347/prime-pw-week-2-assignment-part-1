    <p>See console for output.</p>

    <p>
      Q1) Referring to line 1 in aboutMe.js - console.log('js') was shown in one of the instructional videos, did I need to put it where I did?</p>
    <p>
      Q2) Referring to line 18 in aboutMe.js - Originally tried using the following format: console.log('My name is', fullName, ', and I think'...)
      but it showed an unwanted space before the comma like so: 'My name is Kelsey Brown , and I think...'
      Am I able to use that format without the + for fullName and get rid of the unwanted space?</p>
